# Photic-Sneeze-Tracker
A utility to track the properties and frequency of my son's photic sneezes, from January 1 2022 until December 31, 2022.

Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helioopthalmic Outburst (ACHOO) Syndrome is characterized by uncontrollable sneezing in response to the sudden exposure to bright light, typically intense sunlight

# Questions I should ask first:
1. How many times does he sneeze?
2. At what date and time each sneeze occurs
3. In what environment was he when he sneezed
4. -- inside/outside
5. What kind of light
6. -- Sunlight / Incandescant / Fluorescent / LED
7. What was the source of the light
8. -- looking directly at sun/sudden exposure to daylight/ looking at light bulb/ sudden exposure to artificial light
