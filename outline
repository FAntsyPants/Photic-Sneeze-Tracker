#Outline
This is where I want to lay out an outline of how the program should work.  This page may contain ramblings of pseudo-code, bullshit attempts at jargon, and inside jokes to myself. 

##The Main Task
Track child's sneezes from 01/01/22 - 31/12/22

Pseudo-code most basic steps:

1. Confirm & capture date & time
2. Data input 
3. Parse and export
4. Visualize
